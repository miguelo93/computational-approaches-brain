# <span style="color:#2C1320">Rethinking computational approaches to the brain</span>
### Fundamental challenges and future perspectives 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### <span style="color:#2C1320">21st OCTOBER 2022 - Register Here !!</span>

This online event will bring together researchers with expertise in various areas such as complexity science, machine learning, as well as theoretical neuroscience & philosophy to explore different computational approaches in the study of brain functioning : 

1. What are those approaches essentially about? 
2. What are major benefits & caveats? 
3. Do different approaches speak to, complement, or contradict each other? 
4. What would bring research in the computational sciences forward?
5. What can bring progress into computational approaches to understand the brain?

### <span style="color:#5F4B66">Konrad Kording</span>
<img src="Konrad-Kording-expert-2021-408x452(1).jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:145px;height:200px;float:left; padding-right:20px"/>Dr. Kording is a Penn Integrates Knowledge professor at University of Pennsylvania. Early research in the lab focused on computational neuroscience and in particular movement. The current focus is on Causality in Data science applications. Dr. Kording he's also interested in the question of how the brain solves the credit assignment problem and similarly how we should assign credit in the real world (through causality).
