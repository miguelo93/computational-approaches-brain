This online event will bring together researchers with expertise in various areas such as complexity science, machine learning, as well as theoretical neuroscience & philosophy to explore different computational approaches in the study of brain functioning : 

1. What are those approaches essentially about? 
2. What are major benefits & caveats? 
3. Do different approaches speak to, complement, or contradict each other? 
4. What would bring research in the computational sciences forward?
5. What can bring progress into computational approaches to understand the brain?

### Konrad Kording

Dr. Kording's research has one single focus, data that matters. Early research in the lab focused on computational neuroscience and in particular movement. But as the approaches matured, the focus has more been on discovering ways in which new data sources as well as emerging data analysis can enable awesome possibilities. The current focus is on Causality in Data science applications - how do we know how things work if we can not randomize? Our style of working is transdisciplinary, we collaborate on virtually every project.

### Jessica Flack

Prof. Flack is a professor at Sante Fe Institute, New Mexico, where she runs Collective Computation Group. Her research focuses on evolutionary theory, cognitive neuroscience and behavior, statistical mechanics, information theory, dynamical systems and theoretical computer science to study the roles of information processing and collective computation in the emergence of robust structure and function in adaptive systems.
