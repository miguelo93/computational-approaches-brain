<br>This **online** event will bring together researchers with expertise in various areas such as complexity science, machine learning, as well as theoretical neuroscience & philosophy to explore different computational approaches in the study of brain functioning : 

1. What are those approaches essentially about? 
2. What are major benefits & caveats? 
3. Do different approaches speak to, complement, or contradict each other? 
4. What would bring research in the computational sciences forward?
5. What can bring progress into computational approaches to understand the brain?

The event is organized within the "Sensation and Perception to Awareness: Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarship Programme" at the Univeristy of Sussex. You can ind more info [here](#organizers)
